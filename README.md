**Sentiment Analysis of Online Shopping Reviews**


---

📖 **Overview**

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to classify online shopping reviews from Amazon and Flipkart into:

- Positive

- Neutral

- Negative

The system performs text preprocessing, feature extraction, sentiment scoring, and supervised classification using a Random Forest model.

**Technologies Used**

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- NLTK  
- TextBlob  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- WordCloud

**Project Workflow**

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicates  
- Handled missing values  

### 2️⃣ Text Preprocessing
- Lowercasing  
- Stopword removal  
- Tokenization  
- Stemming  

### 3️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Word count  
- Average word length  
- Special character count  
- TF-IDF representation  
- Sentiment polarity (TextBlob)  

### 4️⃣ Model Training
- **Random Forest Classifier**  
- 80/20 Train-Test Split  

---


**Results**

Accuracy: 100%

Perfect classification on test data

Note: Perfect accuracy may indicate dataset limitations due to small sample size.

---

**Future Improvements**

- Use larger real-world datasets  
- Apply deep learning models (LSTM / BERT)  
- Perform cross-validation  
- Deploy as a web application using Streamlit
